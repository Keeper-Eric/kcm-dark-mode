How to add your logo to KCM:
1. Download the zip file of this repository and extract everything to a folder.
2. Put your logo file as /resources/images/logo.png
3. Open /translations/en.json and put your text for the title of the webpage in place of "Custom Title"
4. (Optional) Put your favicon icons in /resources/images/ as small.png and large.png
5. From inside the kcm-add-logo-1 folder, select all of the folders and files and compress them into a new zip file (add to archive).
6. Make sure that you are viewing file extensions, and change your zip file name and extension to kcm-branding.jar
7. Transfer the kcm-branding.jar file to your KCM server into /etc/kcm-setup/
8. In your docker-compose.yml guacamole section, under environment add USE_DEFAULT_BRANDING: "N" and in volumes right below that add the following line:
   
   &nbsp;-&nbsp;"/etc/kcm-setup/kcm-branding.jar:/etc/guacamole/extensions/kcm-branding.jar:ro"

10. Run the command sudo ./kcm-setup stop (required)
11. Run the command sudo ./kcm-setup upgrade and when prompted press Y for yes.

Complete! Now when you refresh KCM in your browser, you should see your logo on the KCM web page. To refresh the favicons press Ctrl/Cmd + F5 for a hard reload.
